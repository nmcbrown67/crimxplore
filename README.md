First graphics project - imitation

Still have to practice creating my codespace and locally hosted website with React
so copied aspects of setup code from the code Dennis gave us for the comp project 
and then went from there.

What have done so far: 

Implementing vertical scroll with first two background videos

Yet to do:

Implementing next background photos + adding paragraph text.
The code for the NYT article is extremely detailed with a bunch of different 
classes for each background image, trying to figure out how I am going to imitate 
while simplifying so mine is not as extensive.
